This project is a attempt to find patterns using the re module. I created a function with error handling that would parse a user specified file. What I was looking for
was the IP address. Figuring out how to get the IP address was quite difficult and I did spend some time on Stack Overflow looking for a solution. Once the IP 
addresses have been found, the program outputs them in a new file as a list. I tend to use spaces in lists I create. It's easier to read. 

# error_log.txt
This was the provided file to parse. 

# demo01.txt
This was the file containing the resulting list of IP addresses found.
